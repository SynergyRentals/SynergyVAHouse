## RBAC Permission Analysis

### Current Permission Structure
Based on investigation of `seeds/seed_rbac.ts`:

| Role | Project Permissions |
|------|-------------------|
| **Super Admin** | `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, `manage_team` |
| **Manager** | `read`, `update`, `manage_team` |
| **Lead** | `create`, `read`, `update` |
| **VA/Operator** | `read` only |
| **Viewer** | `read` only |

### Test User Analysis
- Test user appears to have **VA/Operator** or **Viewer** role
- Has `projects:read` permission only
- **This is correct security behavior** - prevents unauthorized project creation

---
