Build a Slack-first “Synergy VA Ops Hub” in Replit Agent 3. The app centralizes VA work, enforces SOPs, and gives real-time visibility.

Actors and context

Dan (manager, America/Chicago).

Jorel “@Jorel” (lead, EA + data, Asia/Manila).

Rica “@Rica” (Listing/OTA optimizer, Asia/Manila).

Zyra “@Zyra” (Ops coordinator, Asia/Manila).

Slack is the communication layer. Conduit and SuiteOp emit webhooks.

Work types to manage

Daily and weekly checklists per VA.

Reactive tasks: guest messaging, reservation changes/cancellations/refunds, cleaning, maintenance.

Multi-step projects you assign.

Problems to solve

Missed refunds/cancellations/changes.

Missed guest messages.

Daily/weekly tasks not completed on time.

Missed maintenance/cleaning follow-through.

Low visibility into status and progress.

Over-reliance on Dan for guidance.

Goal
One hub to capture every task, guide execution with playbooks, enforce proof of completion, and report status automatically. Slack is the front door. The web service runs in Replit.

Core features

Slack app surfaces

App Home dashboards.

VA view: Today, Overdue, SLA ticker, Blocked, Next 3 steps, Last 24h completions.

Manager view: RAG by person and category, SLA breaches, aging, project burn-down, reopen rate.

Message action “Create Task” to convert any message into a task with source link.

Slash commands: /task, /project, /brief, /done, /blocker, /handoff.

Scheduled DMs: AM brief 09:00 PH for each VA. PM recap 17:30 PH. Manager digest 09:15 CT.

Inbound triage

Webhooks from Conduit and SuiteOp. Map events into normalized Tasks with category, owner, SLA, and deep links.

Categories include: reservations.refund_request, reservations.cancellation_request, reservations.change_request, guest.messaging_known_answer, access.smart_lock_issue, internet.wifi_issue, cleaning.issue, maintenance.issue, ota.listing_fix, inventory.restock.

SOP Playbooks

YAML playbooks per category. Include steps, examples, SLA, escalation, definition of done (DoD), and required evidence.

Example SLA: first response in 10 minutes when the answer is known. Breach posts to #triage and tags the lead.

Initial playbooks: refund, cancellation, reservation change, known-answer guest reply, smart lock, Wi-Fi, cleaning issue, maintenance issue, OTA fix, inventory restock.

DoD and evidence enforcement

“Mark done” opens a modal that requires specific fields and evidence (IDs, screenshots, links).

Completion is blocked until DoD is met or an exception is approved by Dan or Jorel.

Projects

Lightweight Kanban. Each task tied to a project when applicable.

“Next 3 steps” suggestions to keep momentum.

Follow-up catcher

Detects promises in Slack threads (“on it,” “I’ll update by…,” “ETA”).

Creates follow-up tasks due within a set window and nudges if no update.

Briefings and scorecards

AM/PM briefs for VAs.

Manager digest with weekly scorecard: inbound, completed, open, SLA first-response %, SLA breach count, average reactive cycle time, reopen rate, follow-up created vs satisfied, evidence completeness %, milestones on time.

Access

Org-visible by default. DMs private. Admins: Dan and Jorel. Everyone can create and assign tasks.

Data and persistence

Postgres for Users, Tasks, Projects, Comments, Audits, Metric rollups, Playbooks.

Store evidence metadata and links. Prefer links to source messages and platform pages.

Integrations

Slack: Events, App Home, message actions, slash commands, DMs.

Conduit and SuiteOp: HMAC-verified webhooks for escalations, task events, and AI help requests.

Google Sheets export for weekly scorecards and a task ledger.

SLA and escalation

If a playbook exists and the answer is known, first response SLA is 10 minutes.

Pre-breach nudge at T-5. Breach escalates to #triage, tags assignee and Jorel.

Night rules use Manila hours. Page Dan only if the playbook states it.

AI guidance

The agent suggests category, playbook, next steps, and draft messages.

No guest-facing messages are sent without an explicit Slack approval.

Seed data

Users: Dan, Jorel, Rica, Zyra with Slack IDs and time zones.

Daily and weekly checklists for Rica and Zyra seeded from the provided document.

First five playbooks loaded.

Sandboxes

Install in a staging Slack workspace. Use #triage-sandbox and #open-issues-sandbox. Provide sample webhook payloads.

Non-goals for MVP

No Guesty integration yet.

No autonomous guest messaging.

Success criteria

≥95% on-time first response when a playbook exists.

Zero missed guest messages.

Daily and weekly tasks completed on schedule.

Evidence completeness ≥90%.

Clear weekly scorecard with trend lines.

Acceptance tests

Convert message → task and see it on dashboards.

Conduit escalation creates reactive task with a 10-minute SLA and escalates on breach.

DoD blocks completion until evidence is attached.

Follow-up catcher creates and nudges follow-ups.

AM/PM briefs and manager digest render correct summaries.
