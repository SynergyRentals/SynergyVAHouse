CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES ðŸš¨
Stored XSS Vulnerability (URGENT)

Timestamp: 3:34 PM - Found HTML injection in task names

Evidence: Task contains <img src=x onerror=alert(1)> which renders as executable code

Risk: Complete user account compromise, data theft, malicious script execution

Fix Required: Sanitize ALL user input before database storage + escape HTML on output

Complete Form Validation Bypass (CRITICAL)

Timestamp: 3:33 PM - Successfully created project with ALL empty fields

Evidence: Form submitted with blank name, description, status, dates

Result: System showed "Project created successfully" toast message

Fix Required: Implement both client-side AND server-side validation

MAJOR DATA INTEGRITY ISSUES
Unbounded Text Input Causing Layout Breakage

Timestamp: 3:31 PM - Discovered task names with 1000+ "A" characters

Impact: Modal dialogs become unusable, horizontal scrolling required

Fix Required: Implement character limits (suggest 100-200 chars) + text truncation

Invalid Status Handling

Timestamp: 3:34 PM - Found projects with "INVALID STATUS" displayed

Issue: System accepts arbitrary status values instead of enforcing enum

Fix Required: Implement status validation with proper fallback handling

TECHNICAL ISSUES
WebSocket Connection Failures

Timestamp: 3:35 PM - Console shows continuous 403 errors

Evidence: wss://...realtime â†’ 403 Forbidden every few seconds

Impact: Performance degradation, console pollution

Fix Required: Verify WebSocket authentication headers

Mobile Responsiveness Problems

Timestamp: 3:36 PM - Tested responsive design mode

Issue: Project modals require horizontal scrolling on â‰¤375px screens

Fix Required: Implement responsive modal widths

UX/ACCESSIBILITY ISSUES
Inconsistent Button Behavior

Issue: "New Project" button works at top, similar button lower on page non-functional

Missing: Loading states during form submission

Accessibility Gaps

Missing: aria-labels on interactive elements

Issue: Poor color contrast on muted text (below WCAG AA standards)

PERFORMANCE CONCERNS
Excessive Data Loading

Observation: Page loads ~2MB JSON for all project tasks upfront

Recommendation: Implement lazy loading or pagination

IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
BLOCKING ISSUES for Production:

XSS vulnerability (Security breach risk)
Form validation bypass (Data corruption risk)
Layout breaking text overflow (Unusability)
Recommended Fix Priority:

URGENT: Patch XSS vulnerability + input sanitization

URGENT: Add comprehensive form validation

HIGH: Implement text length limits + UI truncation

MEDIUM: Fix WebSocket errors + mobile responsiveness

LOW: Improve accessibility + UX consistency
